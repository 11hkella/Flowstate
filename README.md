# FLOWSTATE
"flowstate" is a clone of the popular memory game "Simon". It implements similar game logic and tests the player's ability to remember increasingly long sequences of inputs.

# FEATURES
1. Five interactable buttons, mapped to the keyboard, play unique synth sounds and flash custom glow      animations.
2. Custom "Start-up" and "Fail" animations let the player know both when the game is about to begin and when the game is over respectively.
3. The playback sequence that is generated by the computer increases in speed as rounds progress.
4. A score system keeps track of the player's progress. It allows the player to earn points both on round completion as well as on each button press.
5. A "highscore" display keeps track of the players highest score to date.
6. Through integrating tone.js, two unique synth sounds play during the game. A Duo synth is used for the computer voicings, while a Poly synth is used for the player. The Poly synth also allows for multiple button inputs at once, which adds to the fun of noodling around while preparing to play again.
7. Messages to the player are strategically placed in the center of the game board. These messages inform the player when to listen to the pattern and when to repeat it. It also helps the player adapt to the pace of gameplay.
8. As a round ends and the "fail" animation plays, the "Play Game" button reappears and goes through a slow blinking animation to promote multiple playthroughs.

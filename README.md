# DIRECTIONS

Write a Simon game that displays 4 colored buttons (or clickable areas) that light up and play a sound. Have the computer play a random sequence, starting with a length of 1 and growing with each round. If the user can replay the sequence by clicking on the colored buttons in the correct order, then the computer goes to the next round and the sequence gets longer (same sequence but with one new randomly generated selection added to the end). If the user is unable to replay the sequence, then their score is the length of the sequence they successfully replayed.

Have a unique sound for each colored button and play the sound both when the computer plays the sequence and when the user clicks on the buttons to replay the sequence. Have a special sound for when the user makes a mistake.

You may need to figure out "asynchronous programming" in order to make this work

# BONUSES

Display a scoreboard of the longest sequence successfully played to date.

Have a way for the user to choose the difficulty (easy, medium, or hard) where the easy mode plays the sequence slowly (one second per highlighted button) and the hard mode plays the sequence more quickly (1/4 second per highlight).
